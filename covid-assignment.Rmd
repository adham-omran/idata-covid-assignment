Create a tidy dataset for Iraq, relocate the WT column to before the questions
begin.
```
iraq <- data |>
  filter(COUNTRY == 7) |>
  select(-COUNTRY) |>
  relocate(WT, .before = Q1)
```

The pivot_longer() creates tidy data.
```
iraq_tidy <- iraq |>
  pivot_longer(cols = 5:105, names_to = "Question",
               values_to = "Answers") |>
  mutate(DATE = ymd(DATE)) |>
```

Summary stats of Age
```
iraq_tidy |>
  filter(Question == "Q1001") |>
  summary()
```
The youngest participant was 18 years old, the oldest was 70 years old, the mean
(average) was around 35 years old while the median was 33.

```
iraq_tidy |>
  filter(Question == "Q1002") |>
  count(Answer)
```
There are 515 females and 501 males.
